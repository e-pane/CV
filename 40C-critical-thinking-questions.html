        <h1>40C Critical thinking questions</h1>
        <p>Your oldest child has become a professional telemarketer and is hanging out with a gang of hundreds of professional telemarketers.  You have a standard chain link fence around your house, with a gate, that can be electrified with the flip of a switch.
Your child comes home late one night with hundreds of fellow telemarketers.  Your child slips through the gate, and closes the gate.  Hundreds of other telemarketers rush the fence trying to get into your yard.
You can:
1. Flip the switch & electrify the fence once your child is inside the yard, to keep out the rest of the telemarketers, or
2. Go get some steel panels and weld them all around the perimeter of the chain link fence, to keep out the rest of the telemarketers
Explain the fast and slow blocks to polyspermy, and explain which is most similar to 1 or 2 in the scenario above.
</p>
        <p>You're hanging with the roomie, when she decides to go 1991 retro on you.  She asks if you like Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik.  
"Why wouldn't I?", you say, "It's got 2 of the 3 deepest adrenal cortical zonae!".   
And your roomie sighs....
Using the very common "Salt, Sugar, Sex" mnemonic, how can you link the song title to cortical adrenal endocrine function.</p>
        <p>What if, hypothetically, the Black Panther's genius sister, Shuri, were not around to make the perfect vibranium suit?  And instead, some guy named Carl threw one together best as he could.
And let's say, hypothetically, that "cheap suit" caused vibranium to leach into your integument, into the interstitial fluid of your integument, and into your systemic circulation.  And, also hypothetically, let's say you freely filter vibranium at the glomerulus, but have no way to reabsorb it later on in the renal tubule.  
So you go to a urologist and you have your somewhat disconcertingly blue-glowing urine tested, and sure enough, it comes out far too high in vibranium.  What clinical name best fits your unfortunate urinary condition?</p>
        <p>Conceptually, blood flows from the heart, through systemic circulation, on what we call the "arterial" side.  Once this blood is delivered to a capillary bed, it is returned to the heart on what we call the "venous" side.
In the kidney, we have something very strange called "efferent arterioles".  Why does this name contradict the concept explained above, and how can you explain why these blood vessels can be called "efferent arterioles"?</p>
        <p>Zip recruiter calls you with 2 possible job openings.  You can be a Zone 1 cell of a hepatic acinus, or you can work as a Zone 3 cell.
Your friends really want you to take the Zone 3 cell job, but you opt for the Zone 1 job.  How do you explain the pros and cons of the Zone 1 job (vs. the Zone 3 job) to your friends?</p>
        <p>
You're drifting in and out of sleep watching the video module on the ovarian cycle, and you hear "Estrogen levels in the blood inhibit FSH and LH secretion by the anterior pituitary".  Then you drift in and out of sleep some more and you hear "Estrogen levels in the blood stimulate FSH and LH secretion by the anterior pituitary".
How do you explain what you heard?</p>
        <p>You're hosting a huge party at 3 PM.  You get up early in the morning and power through the entire house, cleaning every room, every space, do all the shopping and prepare all the food and drink and all the holiday decorations, looking constantly at that 3 PM deadline to have everything perfectly in place at 3 PM.  None of your guests show up until 9 PM.  From 3 to 9 PM, you putter, just keep cleaning even more, putting up more decorations, making a bit more food, etc..
Explain, in detail, how your work before 3 PM is analogous to the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle, and why your work from 3 to 9 PM is analogous to the secretory phase</p>

        <p>You're an ancient messenger tasked with travelling to the gates of Memphis (the old Egypt version), and letting the city know the Assyrians are coming in hot from Babylon and looking for trouble.
You run up to the city gates, insert your special dagger into a perfectly shaped receptacle and a guard inside the gates is alerted.  He goes tearing around the inside of the city gates, all around the city, yelling at thousands of volunteers.  Each one of those volunteers runs into the city yelling at thousands of young men to stop whatever normal work they were doing and switch to "battle mode".  The "converted" young men run around the city and each young man alerts thousands of soldiers.  Each soldier then runs through the city and hands a battle axe to thousands of citizens.
If a normal second messenger pathway in a target cell responds to stimulation by a water soluble hormone, it will use (in no particular order), cyclic AMP, phosphates, a water soluble hormone, ATP, protein kinase, a water soluble hormone receptor, tons of "regular" proteins, adenylate cyclase. and a G protein.
Match each of these normal second messenger molecules to the story above.

        <p>A given morphine injection dosage of X mg/kg is given to a patient to manage pain during late-stage liver failure.  How often should this dosage be given to ensure morphine remains circulating in the patient&apos;s blood?
Morphine is a polar pharmaceutical (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>), and if we assume no significant metabolic breakdown of morphine in the liver (due to comprehensive liver failure), then clearance of morphine from the body will be primarily via the urine.  Generally, small (morphine is 1/20th the size of insulin) polar pharmaceuticals are freely filtered at the glomerulus and not at all reabsorbed. 
Plasma clearance rate of a substance tells us how much blood can be completely cleared of a given substance (by the kidney) in a given period of time.  If we estimate the plasma clearance rate of morphine, and we estimate the total blood supply of the patient, we can estimate how long it will take that patient&apos;s kidneys to completely clear the blood of a dosage of morphine.
Plasma clearance rate is given by the formula:
Plasma clearance rate (in mL/min) = 
[Morphine](urine) x GFR / [Morphine](blood)
Immediately after dosage, the morphine concentration of the patient&apos;s blood was 430.5 ng/mL.
Immediately after dosage, the morphine concentration of the patient&apos;s urine was 71.8 ng/mL
The measured GFR of the patient was 98.8 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area.
Body surface area, in m<sup>2</sup>, is given by taking the square root of the given calculation       
 (height(cm) x weight(kg)) / 3600
Total blood supply in the human body (in mL) can be estimated by: 
(height(in)<sup>3</sup> x 0.006012) + (14.6 x weight(lbs)) + 604
The patient is 73 inches tall and weighs 216 lbs.
 
How often do you need to give this injected morphine dose to the patient to maintain sufficient blood levels of morphine for adequate palliative care?</p>
